## 💼 Expertise & Leadership
* **Enterprise Stack:** Mastery of MS Stack (ASP.NET → Blazor → Azure) and AWS (Lambda → Bedrock).
* **SAP Ecosystem:** Seamless integration of ML Pipelines with SAP S/4HANA & Power Automate.
* **Global Scale:** Deployed systems across 54 countries, managing $2B+ P&L data.
* **CFO 100 Recognition:** Award-winning leadership in FinTax innovation.

⚡ **Fun fact:** I still write C# faster than Python. I can deploy to Azure/AWS with my eyes closed, yet I still spend 30 minutes debugging dinner decisions.

* **Audit & Risk Management (DT/IDT/BEPS):** Accelerated audit cycles and high-precision risk flagging in both real and synthetic global scenarios.
* **Invoice & Transactional Integrity:** Targeted anomaly detection for fraud prevention with immediate ROI potential upon deployment.
* **Strategic Client Analytics:** Advanced segmentation isolating top-tier revenue drivers.
* **Financial Forecasting & Provisions:** Robust tax provision forecasting with high statistical reliability for predictable reporting.

**Tech Stack & Governance:** Azure ML → SAP S/4HANA → Power BI | ISO 42001 compliant

🔒 **Access Note:** To protect the underlying proprietary architecture and synthetic data structures, I have moved the repository to **Private**. 

**If you are interested in a deep-dive walkthrough or wish to request access to the codebase for review, please reach out to me directly via DM.**

*Disclaimer: All metrics represent anticipated benefits and synthetic data demonstrations. They illustrate architectural patterns and ML applicability, not production system results.*

**Personal Note:** I chose to prioritize working code demos over a quick launch. In the world of Digital Transformation, execution beats ideation every time! ;)
