## 🛠️ The Journey
- **2005:** ASP.NET 2.0 → First production deployment at age 22  
- **2012:** AWS Lambda → Scaling serverless architecture before mainstream adoption  
- **2018:** Azure ML → Architecting enterprise ML pipelines for global scale  
- **2026:** AI Transformation → Solving VAT Compliance, Fraud, and BEPS Risk in Commodity Trading

## 💼 Expertise & Leadership
- **Enterprise Stack:** MS Stack (ASP.NET → Blazor → Azure), AWS (Lambda → Bedrock)  
- **SAP Ecosystem:** ML pipelines integrated with SAP S/4HANA & Power Automate  
- **Global Scale:** Deployed systems across 54 countries, managing $2B+ P&L data  
- **Recognition:** CFO 100 Award for FinTax innovation  

⚡ **Fun fact:** I still write C# faster than Python. I can deploy to Azure/AWS with my eyes closed, yet I still spend 30 minutes debugging dinner decisions.
